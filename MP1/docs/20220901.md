## Project structure
- `Server`
    - wait for client to connect
    - after connect, receive a grep command
    - parse that command
    - query using that parsed grep command
    - pass the output string back
- `Client`
    - single-threaded
        - build n sockets to all servers 
        - stdin the grep command
        - iterate all sockets and send the grep command
        - iterate sockets and read the output
        - print
    - multi-threaded
        - stdin the grep command
        - build n threads, each:
            - has one socket to one server
            - send te grep command
            - wait for the output
            - store in a variable
        - gather the output and print
