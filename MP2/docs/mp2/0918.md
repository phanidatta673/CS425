- Pre
    - Ring
    - SWIM
- Design
    - number of monitors: ceil(n/3)
    - Workflows:
        - `check dead`
            
            ```markdown
            1. Monitor send 5 packets every 0.8 seconds (UDP)
            2. After client receive -> send ack to monitor
            3. After monitor receive -> 
            	- if acks more than nacks:
            		- done
            	- else if (nacks more than acks) || timeout
            		- repeat step 1. for 5 times
            4. Monitor mark dead people
            5. Start multicasting the new memberlist
            ```
            
            - what if 3 monitors died?
            - how to handle if one node is monitored by two monitors?
        - `introduce node`
            
            ```markdown
            1. New node connects to introducer through TCP
            2. Introducer receives the request
            	- Assign node to ring and pass the latest memberlist(with the new 
            		node in it) to everyone including the new node.
            ```
            
        - `node leaves`
            
            ```markdown
            1. Node multicasting the new memberlist
            ```
            
        - `node dead`
            - Will be detected in next iteration
