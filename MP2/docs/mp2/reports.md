# Reports 

## General
1. Algorithm, Design
2. Why it scales to N
3. Protocol

## Explain
1. Why do crash of a node can be detected within 5 seconds of one of any machines in the ring
2. Why can the design talk to others even when 3 nodes are down
3. Why would the system fail if 4 nodes are down

## Logs
- Membership changes
- Failure detected

## MP1
- Mention how it was used to debug

## Measurements
- background bandwidth usage (in Bits/s, not messages/s) for N=6 machines (assuming no membership changes)
- Average bandwidth usage whenever a node joins, leaves or fails (3 different numbers) for N=6 machines
- Plot the false positive rate of your membership service when the message loss rate is 3%, 30% 
    - (you can emulate message losses at the sending end by dropping messages before sending them out to the network)
    - do this last part for a group with N=2, 6 machines (so, 4 total data points). 
    - On any plot, for each data point take at least as many readings as is necessary to get a non-zero false 
        positive rate (at least 5 readings each), and plot averages and standard deviations 
        and confidence intervals. Discuss your plots, donâ€™t just put them on paper, i.e., 
        discuss trends, and whether they are what you expect or not
